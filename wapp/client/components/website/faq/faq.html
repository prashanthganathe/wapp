                                    The process starts by contacting us so that you can discuss your needs with a project coordinator. After this initial discussion, the coordinator will then assign a consultant (or team of consultants) to further define the scope. The assigned consultant will then follow up with you to get any additional technical details he/she may need in order to understand the project and estimate the effort required. Once we have a good understanding of the project and your needs, Wapp will provide you with a formal proposal detailing estimated time and costs, project scope and a preliminary schedule. Once you have reviewed and accepted our proposal, we can begin work on your project.

                                    Yes. Even though Wapp always takes the utmost care to assure that your data and intellectual property are protected, we encourage the execution of a mutual non-disclosure agreement prior to any project initiation. We use an industry standard agreement. You may use this agreement or your organization's legal department may provide one. Please keep in mind that if your company agreement substantially deviates from our standard agreement, it may take longer to execute and/or may be refused.

                                    Depending on the project and/or task, Wapp charges a consulting fee on an hourly, daily or per project basis. For smaller analysis projects done at our facilities, the cost is based on the actual hours spent on the project. The project proposal will include an estimate of the maximum hours for budgeting purposes. Wapp will then bill only the time actually spent on the project. If a project requires a visit to your facility, Wapp usually applies a daily fee. For any project requiring travel, Wapp will also bill for the actual costs incurred for related travel expenses. In some long-term projects, Wapp may utilize a fixed project fee. Please note the following: The exact fee will vary based on the expertise sought, the location of the consultant and other relevant factors. Our fee structure is in line with what you would expect to pay for similar professional services. Regardless of the project, Wapp will provide you with a written proposal outlining the costs. Work on the project can be initiated after your acceptance of the proposal and the issuance of a purchase order. Smaller projects can also be charged to a credit card.

                                    This depends on the project. Many projects will have milestones that are dependent on both you and Wapp. Whenever possible, the project proposal will include a reference to the type of cooperation that will be required in order to successfully complete the project (such as a single point of contact within the organization, timely response to requests for information or decisions, and so on). In general, our project scheduling involves time to complete each task once other milestones have been completed. If decisions or delays on your part cause milestones to be missed, the project schedule may need to be adjusted to reflect that. Do you perform consultation via the phone and Web, or are site visits required? Wapp will strive to minimize the project costs. A major part of the cost of any project is usually travel-related. As such, we will try to accomplish as much as possible via the use of teleconferencing and/or Web meetings. If the situation requires it, Wapp consultants will travel to your location for an in-person meeting. Alternatively, and if you find it more productive, Wapp can host these meetings at one of its offices.
